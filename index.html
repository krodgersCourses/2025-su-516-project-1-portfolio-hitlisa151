    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am married to my wonderful husband, Andy, and we have four children. Three have graduated and the youngest is going to be a freshman this year.</p>
    <p>I teach math at Oakley High School. I love helping students fall in love with math...or at least change their attitude about it a little bit. :)</p>
